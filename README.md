# NodeJS
Install Express framework at your PC.
Goto Routes/index.js file and copy the code I had provided in my index.js file.
You have to change some details for eg: connectionString to your DB.
I had wrappers for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

NOTE: I used MongoDB for my Rest api's.


DB collections schema:

Schema for customers collection in MongoDB

{
“firstName” : “XYZ”,
“age” :  34
}
